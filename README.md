# Excel-Kickstarter

This assignment analyzes data from over 4,000 past Kickstarter projects to uncover any patterns or trends in both the successful and unsuccessful campaigns. 
Data manipulation ans visualization takes place with Excel formulas, pivot charts and graphs which assist with gaining insight into what is needed to be successful 
in a Kickstarter campaign. Statistical analysis also takes place with statistical formulas, including mean, median, variance, and standard deviation. Certain characteristics of campaigns proved to be the most successful:

- starting the campaign in the month of May;
- Film/Video, Technology, and Music categories have the most successful number of campaigns;
- Most successfully funded subcategories include Documentaries, Wearables, and Rock Music. 
- Food and Photography campaigns have the most unsuccessful campaigns, as do Jazz and World Music projects.
